Use:
HTML/CSS
Javascript
AngularJS(Routes for different layouts?)

My MVP

clean concept

menu
3 sections: about me, projects, and contact

a list of the languages i have touched/learned

a brief bit about me

highlighted projects (completed ones) so far: front end



additional features:

finish angular tweets and add that to my portfolio

change how the whole page looks with a button :) (that would be sweet...requires a simple design to pull off but totally doable)

image background - pattern?
css involved menu options (let it show my love for animations/transitions/transforms)
parallax my projects into view (fade in and place)

do I want it to have a side by side view of the code and the actual project?
