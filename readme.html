<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<h2>I am a Full Stack Web Developer</h2>

<p>This is my portoflio that no only showcases my work, but is part of my work as well. I have used most of what I have learned in my time at DigitalCrafts on this portfolio. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Languages/Frameworks Used</h3>

<ul>
    <li>HTML5</li>
    <li>CSS3</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>AngularJS</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 1</h3>

<p>This concept is a redoing of my other portfolio. Not that I hated it, I just wanted it different. Stretch creative muscles.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Menu Arrows
        &lt;p&gt; When I transferred all my files to a more structured format (Sass), I noticed my menu arrows were &quot;phantom drawing&quot; their color where I had placed transparencies. I tested the actual css, even renamed the classes. I finally tested if, due to the Sass nesting, that they inherited something unwanted. So I moved them out, and they worked great. Was worth the challenge since I now will check nesting and inheritance.&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
