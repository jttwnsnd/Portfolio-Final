<h3>Phase 1</h3>
<p>I didnt want my portfolio done on the fly. I have learned from other projects that building without a plan leads to issues that could have been prevented if I had taken the time to plan my approach. This stage, I came up with the general outline of what I wanted.<br/>
Initially, I wanted a single page layout with no scroll. Everything I wanted you to see would be present without the user having to scroll through endless amounts of length. With my current knowledge, it was no easy task. I wanted this fun, and I wanted to be able to explain what I built. So I decided to change directions into a simpler layout. <br/>
The challenges I faced in this phase were as followed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get a simple layout without missing content</li>
	<li>Have interesting CSS animations and effects without looking overdone.</li>
	<li>Something that stretched my skills without getting myself into a corner</li>
	<li>A direction that I am pleased with as my skills continue to grow</li>
</ul>
<p>With the first one, I had sketches after sketches of ideas of how it could go. I reviewed a lot of other designer portfolios for layout inspiration, and was shocked how overcomplicated I made it. So I breathed and went with the look I was most pleased with. The second followed with the first. The more I calmed down and looked at other sites I liked, I noticed that the amount of animations/effects were limited. I went from having nearly everything animated to just those that I wanted. The third and fourth are works in progress at the current moment. I am pleased with the design, and my skills will be growing as I move forward in this program.</p>
